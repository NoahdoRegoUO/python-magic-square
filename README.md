# Python Magic Square Checker

A square is ✨ magic ✨ if all of the *rows, columns and diagonals* each add up to the **same sum**!

In this repo are two files:
- magic_square.py is a file that includes a function for checking if a matrix is square, and another function for checking if a square matrix is magic
- The magic_square_user_interact is a file that makes it easier for the user to input matricies and check if they are magic squares!

If you download the files to try the program, make sure **both files** are in the same folder.

Let me know of any issues, ideas and optimizations!
